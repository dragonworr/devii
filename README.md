# Devii

A blog starter for the modern developer üòé

Next.js + React + TypeScript + Markdown + syntax highlighting = üî•üî•üî•

## Usage

- **Powered by Next.js**: Next.js is by far the simplest way to generate a statically version of a React-based blog.

  This repo conforms to Next's recommended project structure. Check out [their documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) first.

* **Markdown-based**: Just add a Markdown file to `/md/blog` to add a new post to your blog!

* **TypeScript + React**: build your personal website with the powerful tools you love. Aside from the parts that are Markdown-based, everything else is fully built with TypeScript and functional React components. Implementing any sort of interactive widget is often hard using existing Markdown-centric static-site generators, but Devii makes it easy to mix Markdown and React on the same page. Just drop a string of Mardown content into the `<Markdown />` component Devii provides, or load the content from the file system using `loadMarkdownFile`.

* **Frontmatter support**: Every post can include a frontmatter block containing metadata: `title`, `subtitle`, `tags`, `date` (timestamp), `author`, `authorPhoto`, `bannerPhoto`, and `thumbnailPhoto`.

* **Medium-inspired design**: The Markdown renderer (`Markdown.tsx`) provides a default style inspired by Medium. Just modify the CSS in `Markdown.tsx` to customize the design to your liking.

* **Static generation**: you can generate a fully static version of your site using `yarn build && yarn export`. Powered by Next.js.

* **GitHub-style code blocks**: Works out-of-the-box for all programming languages. Just use Markdown's triple backtick syntax with a "language tag" [just like GitHub](https://help.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks). So this:
  <pre>
  ```ts
  // pretty neat huh?
  const test: (arg: string) => boolean = (arg) => {
    return arg.length > 5;
  };
  ```</pre>

  turns into

  ```ts
  // pretty neat huh?
  const test: (arg: string) => boolean = (arg) => {
    return arg.length > 5;
  };
  ```

* **Insanely customizable**: There's nothing "under the hood" here. You can view and modify all the files that provide the functionality listed above. Devii just provides a project scaffold, some Markdown-loading loading utilities (in `loader.ts`), and some sensible styling defaults (especially in `Markdown.tsx`).

  To get started customizing, check out the source code of `index.tsx` (the home page), `BlogPost.tsx` (the blog post template), and `Markdown.tsx` (the Markdown renderer).
